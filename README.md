Learnings :
I learnt that through Tracing we can see how the workflow execution is done by LLM and what happened at each step, we can also add some metadata with traces to make it more meaningful, A trace contains runs, including a root run. A very simple way to add traces is using the traceable decorator, traces are a trememdous help in debugging and understanding monitoring performance

Tweaking:
I added custom metadata, including custom metadata at runtime, defined a new function langsmith_rishit which has its own set of input documents instead of using the default function from the repository and traced it, also added metadata in those traces, I have uploaded annotated screenshots in my code to put up a better understanding of whats happening, I added some questions and arguments of my own in the orignal code as well.
